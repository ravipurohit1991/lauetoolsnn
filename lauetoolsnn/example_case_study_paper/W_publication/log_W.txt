Using Multiprocessing (16 cpus) for generation of simulated Laue patterns for training
Generating training dataset
Calculating the HKL bounds for training dataset
Total spots created for calculating HKL bounds:5495
Max HKL index:10.0
Min HKL index:-10.0
Directory for training dataset is : C:\Users\purushot\Desktop\pattern_matching\experimental\GUIv0\latest_version//W_publication
Generating HKL objects
Removing harmonics and building equivalent HKL objects
Finalizing the HKL objects
Saved class HKL data in : C:\Users\purushot\Desktop\pattern_matching\experimental\GUIv0\latest_version//W_publication//classhkl_data_W.pickle
Calculating Mutual angular distances
Constructing histograms
Verifying if two different HKL class have same angular distribution (can be very time consuming depending on the symmetry)
Great! No two HKL class have same angular distribution

Model already exists? Lets Predict!
on the fly prediction (fingers crossed)
