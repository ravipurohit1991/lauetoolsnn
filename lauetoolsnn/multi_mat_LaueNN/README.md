# lauetoolsnn python scripts 
In this repository we have included few scripts that will show the capability of the LaueNN to detect many phases (here 4 phases). The scripts can be modified to include more or less number of materials to detect. 

## Step 1: Generation of training dataset and training the neural network script: multi_mat_generation_training_LaueNN.py

## Step 2: Generate simulated Laue Image of multi-phase material: multi_mat_simulatedata_LaueNN.py

## Step 3: verify the neural network prediction and indexation of multi-phase Laue Images: multi_mat_verifyPrediction_LaueNN.py
